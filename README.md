The concept is a player vs player (PVP) game where you can summon animals and use them to score
goals. The game works similar to football, where your goal is to send animals (the ball) through the
portal (the goal). Each animal you spawn/summon has its own attributes, specialties and
interactions on the field.

Tools Used - Unity, C# and Arduino.
